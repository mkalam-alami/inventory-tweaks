## What's this project about

This Open Source project (see [License](https://github.com/mkalam-alami/inventory-tweaks/blob/master/src/doc/license.txt)) is a client mod for [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/), a game by [Mojang AB](http://mojang.com/). It implements various features to help players with the management of inventories and chests. A lot of effort has been put to make it as customizable as possible, without being annoying to set up.
